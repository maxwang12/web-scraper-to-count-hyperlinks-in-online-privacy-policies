# Privacy Policy Hyperlink Web Scraper:

Description: This repository contains code for a web scraper, which reads in and counts embedded links within 46,000 privacy policies across various business domains and 2009 and 2019. The dataset is the Princeton-Leuven Longitudinal Corpus of Privacy Policies. This project tries to determine which kinds of companies and years are associated with more or less hyperlinks in their privacy policies -- links that direct online users to new web pages. 

Links that direct online users to new web pages potentially affect the usability and readability of privacy policies. While this project does not answer the question of whether hyperlinks affect the usability and readability of privacy policies, it tries to get a ground truth of the identities and years associated with greater hyperlink usage in privacy policy creation. Such insights reveal which kinds of companies tend to require users to click through to more web pages to access pertinent information related to a company's privacy policy.
